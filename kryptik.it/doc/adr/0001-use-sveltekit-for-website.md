# 1. Use SvelteKit for Website

* Status: accepted
* Date: 2025-08-31

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to build a modern, fast, and maintainable website for Kryptik.it. The website will serve as a portfolio, blog, and contact point. We need a framework that is easy to learn, has a good developer experience, and produces high-performance websites.

## Considered Options

* **SvelteKit:** A full-stack framework built on Svelte. It offers server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and a great developer experience.
* **Next.js:** A popular React-based framework. It's powerful and has a large ecosystem, but can be complex.
* **Astro:** A newer framework that focuses on content-heavy websites and ships zero JavaScript by default.

## Decision Outcome

We have chosen to use SvelteKit. It provides the best balance of performance, developer experience, and features for our needs. Svelte's simplicity and performance are a major advantage, and SvelteKit provides the structure and features needed for a modern web application.
